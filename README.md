# Hi! This is Alex. Welcome to my Github profile!

### About me

I am a tech professional that is interested in The Cloud, Linux, and Automation. I hope one day to have a career in DevOps.
I completed my Azure Administrator Associate certificate in August and am now working on studying for the Linux+.
I also enjoy working with Python and PowerShell, and continue studying these while also studying for the Linux+

I have worked in a few industries throughout my career. I have worked in small family owned companies and large enterprises.
My career has taken me through many areas of tech including the manufacturing, financial, retial, and service providder industries. 
I have gained many unique experiences from every industry, and I feel all of them have helped me as I further my career.

### Items I've worked on

I have several Python projects on my profile. These include a TCP server/client and some Azure SDK scripts.
I hope to work more with Azure SDK, so expect to see more of those scripts on my profile.
I use powershell most frequently with administrating Azure, but also occaisonally write scripts as well.
I hope to get more of those on my profile as well.
