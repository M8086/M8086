# Hi! This is Alex, welcome to my Github profile!

### About me

I am a tech professional that is interested in The Cloud, Linux, and Automation. I hope one day to have a career in DevOps.
I completed my Azure Administrator Associate certificate in August and am now working on studying for the Linux+.
I also enjoy working with Python and PowerShell, and continue studying these while also studying for the Linux+

### Items I've worked on

I have several Python projects on my profile. These include a TCP server/client and some Azure SDK scripts.
I hope to work more with Azure SDK, so expect to see more of those scripts on my profile.
I use powershell most frequently with administrating Azure, but also occaisonally write scripts as well.
I hope to get more of those on my profile as well.

* 🎸 Music (I play guitar)
* 🐈 Cat herding (Even one is a full time job!)
